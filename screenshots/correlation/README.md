# Cross-Sensor Correlation Screenshot

This directory contains a screenshot demonstrating correlation across
multiple telemetry sources within Splunk.

Evidence includes:

- Network reconnaissance observed simultaneously in Zeek and Suricata
- Validation of attacker activity across independent sensors
- Increased detection confidence through cross-sensor correlation

This screenshot illustrate how multiple data sources are combined
to reduce false positives and improve SOC decision-making.
